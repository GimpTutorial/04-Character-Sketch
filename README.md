+ Michael Introduces what it coming up in Section 4

### 2 Section 4 Specification
+ Art Style
+ Actual Character
+ No real dimension requirement

+ Start from the ground up
+ Human
+ Line art
+ Focus on form

### 3 Drawing Options
Section focused on principles of character creation

#### Drawing Choices
+ Digital stylus
+ Pen and paper
+ Touch screen
+ Trackpad / Mouse

### 4 Basic Shapes
+ Practice your basic shapes
+ This will give you confidence with your art
+ Also provide you with a strong foundation
+ Experiment combining shapes to make new shapes

### 4a The Paths Tool
+ Super useful for drawing curves especially long ones!
+ Especially if you donâ€™t have a stylus.

### 5 First Principle References
+ Use them!
+ Gather many references
+ Help with inspiration
+ Essential communicating and convincing your viewer
+ Get source material wherever possible
+ Take care with references

### 6 Using Building Blocks
+ Putting together basic shapes to make more complicated forms
+ Used for building up an image
+ Used for breaking down an image
+ Used with layers / lighter grey

### 6a Toolbox Transforms
+ Learn about the 6 Toolbox Transforms

### 7 Bone Structure
+ Understanding the foundations of a character
+ Allows sensible posing and animation

### 8 Proportions
+ Using the head technique for proportions
+ Allows you to construct humans of differing sizes
+ Helps maintain consistency through your drawing

### 9 Basic 3D Shapes
+ Even though we are working 2D
+ Often our subjects are not flat
+ Practice your basic 3D forms

### 10 Importing Line Work
+ How to import drawings you have done
+ Tips on getting the best import

### 11 Presence Through Use Of Value
+ A sense of Depth can be achieved though multiple ways
+ Use of Value
+ Affordance through surface lines/shading
+ Almost like faked ambient occlusion

### 12 The Free Select Tool
+ Isolating parts of an image
+ Other method can be just as quick

### 13 Surfaces and Overlap
+ The use of layering and overlap
+ Using Surfaces to place objects

### 13a Caging
+ Using shapes to define boundaries of a drawing

### 14 Presence Through Use Of Perspective
+ Size differences of same objects
+ Foreshortening

### 15 Lighting Basics
+ Introduction to direction lighting

### 15a Avoiding Tangents
+ Tangents occur when two or more lines converge
+ Avoiding tangent is key to keeping an illusion of depth
+ Aids clarity and readability

### 16 Exploration Through Studies
+ Drawing done in preparation of a final piece
+ Use to understand the challenges of your work
+ Plan elements to be Used
+ Studies can be focus on a tiny part of drawing or whole form as we have been doing
+ Other studies might focus on lighting, colour, perspective and general composition.

### 17 Understanding Anatomy
+ Gives a fundamental understanding of how bodies are constructed
+ Makes it easier to construct hybrids
+ Helps with creating a realistic physique

### 18 Study Of The Head
+ Understanding the overall shape of the head
+ Learn quick ways of drawing the head in multiple positions

### 19 Study Of The Eyes
+ Getting eye just right
+ What to avoid when drawing eyes
+ How the eyes and brow communicate

### 19a Study Of The Eyes Challenge
+ Michael draws an eye study

### 20 Study Of The Eyes
+ Getting nose made using a couple of circles and lines
+ The nose is poorly define with few hard edges
+ Most of the form is made through shading

### 21 Study Of The Mouth
+ Shape of the mouth is highly flexible
+ How the lips interact and overlap
+ The Shape and position of teeth
